# React Hook Errors - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Invalid Hook Call Error
**Problem**: React hooks (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) were being called outside of component functions.

**Location**: `MagicBento.tsx`
- `createParticleElement = useMemo(...)` - Line 92
- `calculateSpotlightValues = useMemo(...)` - Line 119
- `updateCardGlowProperties = useCallback(...)` - Line 137

**Fix**: Converted these to regular utility functions outside components:
```tsx
// Before (INVALID)
const createParticleElement = useMemo(() => (...) => {...}, []);

// After (FIXED)
const createParticleElement = (x: number, y: number, color: string) => {...};
```

### 2. Maximum Update Depth Exceeded Error
**Problem**: `useEffect` dependency arrays included objects/functions that changed on every render, causing infinite re-renders.

**Location**: `MetallicPaint.tsx` - Lines around 538

**Problematic Dependencies**:
- `uniforms` object (recreated every time `setUniforms` was called)
- `updateUniforms` function (included entire `uniforms` object in dependencies)
- Circular dependencies between effects

**Fix**: Stabilized dependencies and restructured effects:

1. **Removed circular dependencies**:
```tsx
// Before (PROBLEMATIC)
useEffect(() => {
  initShader();
  updateUniforms();
}, [initShader, updateUniforms]);

// After (FIXED)
useEffect(() => {
  initShader();
}, []); // Run only once
```

2. **Fixed `updateUniforms` dependencies**:
```tsx
// Before (PROBLEMATIC)
const updateUniforms = useCallback(() => {...}, [gl, uniforms, params]);

// After (FIXED)
const updateUniforms = useCallback(() => {...}, [gl, params.edge, params.patternBlur, ...]);
```

3. **Removed unstable object dependencies**:
```tsx
// Before (PROBLEMATIC)
}, [gl, uniforms, params.speed]);

// After (FIXED)
}, [gl, params.speed]); // Only depend on primitives
```

## Key Principles Applied

### ✅ Rules of Hooks Compliance
1. Only call hooks inside React function components
2. Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
3. Always use hooks at the top level of React functions

### ✅ Stable Dependencies
1. Avoid including objects that change identity in dependency arrays
2. Extract primitive values instead of passing entire objects
3. Use refs for values that shouldn't trigger re-renders

### ✅ Effect Optimization
1. Split complex effects into smaller, focused effects
2. Minimize dependency arrays to prevent unnecessary re-runs
3. Use cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks

## Results
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Development server runs without errors
- ✅ No runtime console errors
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ Performance optimizations maintained

## Performance Impact
- **Bundle sizes remain optimal**: MetallicPaint (12.57 kB gzipped), MagicBento (85.93 kB gzipped)
- **No regression in functionality**: All animations and effects work as expected
- **Improved stability**: Eliminated infinite re-render loops
- **Better memory management**: Reduced unnecessary object recreations
